  - Added "Consistent Drops" option. If enabled, save items will drop based on
    the proportion of killed enemies, meaning if 3 are set per map, one will drop
    at 30% kills, one at 60% and one at 90%. There is still some variation.

    added to the players inventory when they are dropped, rather than falling
	on the ground.

1.31:
  - Updated Corner Messages to be more readable
  - Rolling for save items in non-consistent mode no longer biases enemies
  killed later, making the distribution of items far more fair and balanced.
  - Added a setting to grant additional save items based on the number of the
  enemies in the map.
  - Updated default settings to be more dynamic and feel more natural.
  - Fixed off-by-one errors that were sometimes preventing the final save item
  from dropping if it was rolled by the last enemy in a map.

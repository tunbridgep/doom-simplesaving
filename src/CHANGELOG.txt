1.0:
  - Release Version

1.1:
  - Added "Style" selection, now you can pick what fits your game better.
  - Fixed numerous bugs.
  - Added some polish.

1.2:
  - Added "Consistent Drops" option. If enabled, save items will drop based on
    the proportion of killed enemies, meaning if 3 are set per map, one will drop
    at 30% kills, one at 60% and one at 90%. There is still some variation.
  - Added "Auto Pickup" option. If enabled, all save items will be immediately
    added to the players inventory when they are dropped, rather than falling
	on the ground.

# Simple Saving

A simple saving mod for doom, attempting to remove savescumming by restricting free saving and instead requiring the use of a resource in order to save.

# Features

* ZScript based
* Complete removal of save-scumming, focusing on resource-based saving instead
* Configuration Menu
* A new button replaces the Save hotkey and prevents saving at-will
    * Saving can be accomplished through the use of a Ankh of Time Manipulation
    * How often these drop, starting amount, and whether they are removed at the end of each level can be configured
* Works for all Doom-Engine games including Doom, Doom 2, Heretic, Hexen and Strife, as well as any other IWADs or PWADs
